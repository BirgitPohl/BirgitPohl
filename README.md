### Hi there 👋

This is Birgit.

I'm an Engineering Manager. One of those engineers who build and debug teams.

The reason is, I have noticed, that many people come together because of their coding skills, but lose their minds because of lack of communication. Here is where my work starts:

I enable teams to do, what they are good at. With my background knowledge in software engineering and my people-skills I bring development, business, design and users closer together and I create frictionless working environments.

I am a people- and user-orientated servant leader with more than 8 years of deep technical experience developing, implementing complex infrastructures, and supporting teams for fast-growing startups and bigger ships such as corporate in various industries. Health tech, Fintech, Social Media, eCommerce and Blockchain.

My main leadership style is mentorship and coaching. I'll be asking lots of questions and ask your for your goals.

I am a strong believer in `honesty`, `transparency`, a `people-first attitude`, and `psychological safety`.
