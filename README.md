### Hi there 👋

This is Birgit.

I'm an Engineering Manager. One of those engineers who don't code that much.

The reason is, I have noticed, that many people come together because of their coding skills, but lose their minds because of lack of communication. Here is where my work starts:

I enable teams to do, what they are good at. With my background knowledge in software engineering and my people-skills I bring development, business, design and users closer together and I create frictionless working environments.

I am a people- and user-orientated servant leader with more than 8 years of deep technical experience developing, implementing complex infrastructures, and supporting teams for fast-growing startups and bigger ships such as corporate in various industries. Health tech, Fintech, Social Media, eCommerce and Blockchain.

I am a strong believer in `honesty`, `transparency`, a `people-first attitude`, and `psychological safety`.
